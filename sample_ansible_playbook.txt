Here is a rough sample ansible playbook I used in my own system
to install the service. 

This will most likely need to be customized for your own setup, but it
could be a good starting point.

- name: install python3-pip
  apt:
    pkg: python3-pip
    state: present
    cache_valid_time: 3600
    update_cache: yes

- name: Git clone hover-dns-updater
  git:
    repo: 'https://github.com/mreishus/hover-dns-updater'
    dest: /usr/local/src/hover-dns-updater

- name: Install python requirements for hover-dns-updater
  pip:
    requirements: /usr/local/src/hover-dns-updater/requirements.txt
    executable: pip3

- name: Install hover-dns-updater
  command: /bin/sh INSTALL.sh chdir=/usr/local/src/hover-dns-updater creates=/etc/hover-dns-updater/hover-dns-updater.json

- name: Copy config file
  copy:
    src: hover-dns-updater.json
    dest: /etc/hover-dns-updater/hover-dns-updater.json
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644
  register: hoverconf

- name: keep Hover running
  systemd:
    state: started
    name: hover-dns-updater

- name: restart Hover on change
  systemd:
    state: restarted
    daemon_reload: yes
    name: hover-dns-updater
  when: hoverconf.changed
